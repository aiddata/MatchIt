\section{Checking Balance}
\label{sec:balance}

\subsection{Quick Overview}

To check balance, use \texttt{summary(m.out)} for numerical summaries
and \texttt{plot(m.out)} for graphical summaries We illustrate here
with three examples.

\subsection{Details}

\subsubsection{The {\tt summary()} Command}

The \texttt{summary()} command gives measures of the balance between
the treated and control groups in the full (original) data set, and
then in the matched data set.  If the matching worked well, the
measures of balance should be smaller in the matched data set.

The \texttt{summary()} output for subclassification is the same as
that for other types of matching, except that the balance statistics
are shown separately for each subclass, and the overall balance in the
matched samples is calculated by aggregating across the subclasses,
where each subclass is weighted by the number of units in the
subclass.  For exact matching, the covariate values within each
subclass are guaranteed to be the same, and so the measures of balance
are not output for exact matching; only the sample sizes in each
subclass are shown.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Balance statistics:} The statistics the \texttt{summary()}
  command provides include means, standardized biases, and
  Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plot summary statistics.  In
  addition, the \texttt{summary()} command will report (a) the matched
  call, (b) how many units were matched, unmatched, or discarded due
  to the \texttt{discard} option (described below), and (c) the
  percent improvement in balance for each of the balance measures,
  defined as $100((|a|-|b|)/|a|)$, where $a$ is the balance before and
  $b$ is the balance after matching.  For each set of units (original
  and matched data sets), the following statistics are provided:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item ``Means Treated'' and ``Means Control'' show the weighted
    means in the treated and control groups
  \item ``Treated SD'' is the standard deviation of the covariate in
    the set of treated units
  \item ``Std. Bias'' is the difference in means in the treated and
    control groups, divided by the ``Treated SD'' calculated using all
    treated units.  The same standard deviation is used for
    calculating the standardized bias in the original and the matched
    data sets so that the success of the matching at reducing bias in
    the covariate means can be easily assessed; standardizing by the
    same quantity puts the two differences in means on the same scale.
    Good matches will generally have means less than a quarter of a
    standard deviation apart (a standardized biases of less than
    0.25), although smaller is better and only zero is perfect.
  \item The final three columns of the summary output give summary
    statistics of a Q-Q plot (see below for more information on these
    plots). Those columns give the median, mean, and maximum distance
    between the two empirical quantile functions (treated and control
    groups).  Values greater than 0 indicate deviations between the
    groups in some part of the empirical distributions.  The plots of
    the two empirical quantile functions themselves, described below,
    can provide further insight into which part of the covariate
    distribution has differences between the two groups.
\end{enumerate}

\item {\bf Additional options:} Two options to the \texttt{summary()}
  command can also help with assessing balance and respecifying the
  propensity score model, as necessary.  First, the {\tt interactions
    = TRUE} option with {\tt summary()} shows the balance of all
  squares and interactions of the covariates used in the matching
  procedure.  Large differences in higher order interactions usually
  are a good indication that the assignment model needs to be
  respecified.  Similarly, the {\tt addlvariables} option with {\tt
    summary()} will provide balance measures on additional variables
  not included in the original matching procedure.  If a variable (or
  interaction of variables) not included in the original distance
  measure has large imbalances in the matched groups, including that
  variable in the next model specification may improve the resulting
  balance on that variable.  Because the outcome variable is not used
  in the matching procedure, a variety of matching methods can be
  tried, and the one that leads to the best resulting balance chosen.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The \texttt{plot()} Command}

We can also examine the balance graphically using the \texttt{plot()}
command, which provides two types of plots: jitter plots of the
distance measure, and Q-Q plots of each covariate.  In the jitter
plot, which can be created by setting \texttt{type = "jitter"}, you
may identify units by observation name by clicking the first mouse
button near the units. For subclassification, separate Q-Q plots are
printed for each subclass.  The jitter plot for subclassification is
the same as that for other types of matching, with the addition of
vertical lines indicating the subclass cut-points.

Two examples of the output from the {\tt plot()} command are shown
below.  If the empirical distributions are the same in the treated and
control groups, the points would all lie on the 45 degree line.
Deviations from the 45 degree line indicate differences in the
empirical distribution.  The jitter plot shows the overall
distribution of propensity scores in the treated and control groups.
In the jitter plot, the size of each diamond is proportional to the
weight given to that unit; matched units are in black while unmatched
units are in grey.
