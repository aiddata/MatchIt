new features

matchit
- spatial input option handling and verification
- spatial nearest neighbor matching
    + spatial caliper & distance decay functions


demo
- spatial demo
- spatial proof of concept


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
general improvements

- improved code styling (spacing, indentation, line length, loop/conditional format)
- improved various variable names for clarity
- added comments

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bugs

- FIXED: in nearest matching when using caliper and calclosest and pool == 0, it was including discarded control units in list of possible matches


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
issues

- forced random sample from pool of eligible controls when using caliper

- no real information is returned if matching fails due to no enough matches
    + calclosest option description could be improved a bit, maybe with a simple example and someting regarding the implications of using this
    + added a warning that provides number of treated units not matched due to caliper
    + add a "calrandom" option to nearest matching (default=FALSE) where when FALSE will use the nearest match and when TRUE will randomly match from the pool (identical to old functionallity)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
todo

- spatial documentation
- add spatial functionality to remaining matching options
- improve spatial demo / proof of concept
